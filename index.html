      <h2>Welcome to my site</h2>
      <p>
        This site is to list and describe ongoing projects and my research into those projects. Each page linked in my side bar will be about a new project/hobby. I hope to add a new page each week. This first version, I'm going to make 2 pages about coffee and running.

      <h3>Online Security</h3>
      <p>
        In my previous occupation, I managed a multi-doctor and multi-specialty private medical practice. I was also in charge of the technical department and incorporating new technology and medical software. 
        As our practice began to transition away from paper to a digital workflow, I found myself frequently coming across online security and HIPAA level compliance
        regarding storage of patient medical records, insurance claim information and communication with other organizations containing patient sensitive data. It is from
        this first hand experience that I began to see all the implications of online security and how it can swing from robust security to frailty depending on simple
        exploits and context. 
        <br>
        I want to dedicate a page on my site to researching and learning about online security and how businesses are affected. I plan to organize online resources
        and provide notes and summaries of those resources.
