      <a href="http://dailythunder.com">Daily Thunder</a> - a site dedicated to following the OKC Thunder team.
      <ol>
        <li>I see some familiar html elements in the dailythunder site such as the head and body tags. I see some div-class tags that I think are used to create borders and sub borders for each section. I see some CSS and script terms that I think are implementing some stylistic themes via scripts. The information and layout look a lot cleaner and more streamlined than my site.</li>
